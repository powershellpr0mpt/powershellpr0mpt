## Hi Robert here 👋

I love learning new things and sharing whatever I learn with others.  
I'm a Developer at [Wortell](https://github.com/wortell) and I love to focus on automation and optimizing processes!

Frequent attendee and have also been speaker at [PSConfEU](https://psconf.eu) , loving the PowerShell community!  
⚡ Fun fact: this year (2025) I will be speaking at both [PSConfEU](https://psconf.eu) and [Experts Live Netherlands](https://www.expertslive.nl/)!  
Come join me and say hi!
